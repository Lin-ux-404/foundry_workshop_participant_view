# Workshop guide

## Completion outcome

Every team finishes with a grid-operations assistant that:

1. answers a procedure question from grounded knowledge and returns sources;
2. calls at least one deterministic tool or workflow step;
3. records an inspectable trace;
4. passes the repository's deterministic checks; and
5. has one Foundry evaluation run that the team can explain.

The goal is a reliable vertical slice. Hosted deployment, Toolboxes, custom
ingestion and advanced multi-agent patterns are stretch work.

## Audience and team model

- Level: Foundry 100–200.
- Assumed skills: Python fundamentals, JSON, basic command-line use and general
  cloud concepts.
- Recommended team size: three to five.
- Recommended support ratio: one active technical facilitator per ten learners.
- Every team receives a unique `WORKSHOP_RESOURCE_NAMESPACE`.

Suggested team roles:

- **Driver:** shares the screen and runs the current step.
- **Navigator:** reads instructions and checks success criteria.
- **Operator:** watches identity, quota and portal state.
- **Evaluator:** maintains the test cases and records results.

Rotate the driver after each required lab.

| 14:50–15:15 | DRAAD application integration smoke test and RAG release view |
| 15:15–15:30 | Evaluation comparison, takeaways and cleanup |

## Evidence checklist

Each team places the following in its handoff notes:

- team namespace and Foundry project;
- agent name and model deployment;
- one grounded question, response and source;
- one tool input/output pair;
- trace or correlation identifier;
- evaluation run name and metric summary;
- live RAG row with retrieval recall, required-answer-part coverage, citation
  coverage, groundedness, response completeness, latency and token/request
  usage;
- one failure encountered and the recovery used;
- optional extension completed.

No secrets, keys, access tokens or personal data belong in the handoff.

## Preview fallback rules

- If Foundry IQ is unavailable, complete the direct Search lab and compare the
  architecture conceptually using the provided sample retrieval output.
- If a model-based evaluator is unavailable, run deterministic schema/tool tests
  and record the unavailable evaluator as skipped.
- If tracing export is delayed, inspect the local OpenTelemetry spans and retain
  the correlation identifier.
- Hosted agents, Toolboxes, Prompt Optimizer and preview evaluators never block
  the required completion outcome.
